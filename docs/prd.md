# Project Requirement Document (PRD): Image Sequence Animator React Component

## 1. Overview
The **Image Sequence Animator** is an open-source ReactJS component library that allows developers to pass a list of image URLs (approximately 100 URLs) and animate them sequentially to mimic a video-like experience. The component provides user controls for playback, including pause, speed adjustment, backward, and forward navigation.

### 1.1 Purpose
- Provide a lightweight, reusable React component for developers to integrate image-based animations in web applications.
- Enable smooth sequential display of images with video-like controls.
- Ensure compatibility with modern web applications and open-source distribution under a permissive license (e.g., MIT).

### 1.2 Scope
- A single React component (`ImageSequenceAnimator`) that accepts image URLs as input.
- Features: Sequential image playback, pause/resume, speed control, forward/backward navigation.
- Output: A published npm package with documentation and examples.
- Open-source with contributions encouraged via GitHub.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **Input**:
  - Prop: `imageUrls` (array of strings, ~100 URLs pointing to image files, e.g., PNG, JPEG).
  - Optional prop: `frameRate` (default: 30 FPS, adjustable by user).
  - Optional prop: `loop` (boolean, default: true, to loop animation).
- **Output**:
  - Renders a sequence of images in order, displayed within a defined container.
  - Animation resembles a video, with one image per frame.
  - Supports user controls:
    - **Pause/Resume**: Toggle playback.
    - **Speed Control**: Adjust playback speed (e.g., 0.5x, 1x, 2x).
    - **Backward/Forward**: Navigate to previous/next frame or rewind/fast-forward.
- **UI**:
  - Display the current image in a responsive container.
  - Provide a control bar with buttons for play/pause, speed selection, and navigation (backward/forward).
  - Optional prop for custom styling (e.g., `className`, `style`).

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:
  - Optimize image loading to handle ~100 URLs efficiently (e.g., preload images, lazy-load as needed).
  - Smooth animation without frame drops on modern browsers (targeting 30 FPS or higher).
  - Memory-efficient to avoid crashes with large image sets.
- **Compatibility**:
  - Supports modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
  - Compatible with React 16.8+ (using hooks).
- **Accessibility**:
  - Keyboard-navigable controls (e.g., spacebar for pause/resume).
  - ARIA labels for screen readers.
- **Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive README with installation, usage, and prop descriptions.
  - Live demo/example via Storybook or a demo site.
- **Licensing**:
  - Published under MIT License.
- **Maintainability**:
  - Modular code with TypeScript support for type safety.
  - Unit tests covering core functionality.

### 2.3 Assumptions
- Image URLs are publicly accessible and loadable via HTTP/HTTPS.
- Images are of consistent dimensions for smooth animation.
- Users have stable internet connections for loading images.

### 2.4 Constraints
- No server-side processing; all logic runs client-side.
- Limited to image-based animation (no video file support).
- Control UI is minimalistic to keep the library lightweight.

## 3. User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to pass a list of image URLs to the component so that I can display them as an animation.
2. As a developer, I want to customize the frame rate and loop behavior to suit my applicationâ€™s needs.
3. As a user, I want to pause and resume the animation to control playback.
4. As a user, I want to adjust the playback speed to view the animation faster or slower.
5. As a user, I want to navigate backward or forward to specific frames for precise control.
6. As a developer, I want clear documentation and TypeScript support to integrate the component easily.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Given a valid list of image URLs, the component animates images in sequence at the specified frame rate.
- Playback controls (pause, speed, navigation) function correctly and are responsive.
- The component handles edge cases (e.g., empty URL list, failed image loads) gracefully with error messages.
- Documentation includes installation steps, prop descriptions, and a working example.
- Tests pass with at least 80% code coverage.
- The package is published to npm and installable in a React project.

## 5. Technical Specifications
- **Framework**: ReactJS (16.8+ with hooks).
- **Language**: JavaScript with TypeScript for type definitions.
- **Build Tool**: Vite or Create React App for bundling.
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests.
- **Documentation**: README and Storybook for interactive demos.
- **Publishing**: npm package with semantic versioning.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Minimal external libraries (e.g., styled-components for styling, if needed).
  - No heavy dependencies like video processing libraries.

## 6. Milestones
1. **Prototype**: Basic component with image sequence animation.
2. **Core Features**: Add playback controls (pause, speed, navigation).
3. **Polish**: Add TypeScript, tests, accessibility, and documentation.
4. **Release**: Publish to npm and set up GitHub repository.

## 7. Risks
- **Performance**: Large image sets may cause lag or memory issues.
  - Mitigation: Implement lazy-loading and image preloading.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Variations in animation timing across browsers.
  - Mitigation: Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations.
- **Contributor Adoption**: Limited community interest in open-source library.
  - Mitigation: Provide clear contribution guidelines and a demo site.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Support for image pre-processing (e.g., resizing, compression).
- Custom transitions between frames (e.g., fade, slide).
- Integration with WebGL for advanced animations.
- Support for local image files via File API.
